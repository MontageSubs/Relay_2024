We all knew the trials were inadequate.
内部都明白这些试验不严谨

839
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:11,380
They said things were safe way before we knew enough.
还没弄清楚前 公司就说一切安全了

840
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:16,050
You know how widely it was distributed.

Millions of people will have been affected,

853
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,220
It was crazy.
太艰难了

854
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,910
I figured drinking would help me to fit in
我以为喝酒能帮我合群

855
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,120
and just connect to people more.
跟人打成一片

856
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,530
And it did, a little.
确实 有一点作用

857
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:27,030
Didn't stop me getting my ass kicked all the time.
可是还是经常被人痛揍

858
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:32,360
But when that happened, it would help me go numb.
被打的时候 喝酒能麻痹痛苦

859
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,790
So, either way, it helped.
总之 酒是帮了我

860
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,050
And then I got a job on Wall Street.

861
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,620
It was intense.
工作强度非常高

862
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,720
Drinking was part of fitting in.
喝酒也是合群的一部分

863
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,160
And it was a way of dealing
也用来应付那些

864
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:46,260
with pressure to meet these crazy targets.
变态业绩指标的压力

865
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,210
There was no way of meeting them.
根本不可能完成那些指标

866
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,400

Much as I wanted to be a part of something,

I didn't wanna be a part of that.
但不想同流合污

870
01:13:57,290 --> 01:14:00,180
So, I started gathering information,

871
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,220
and I took it to my superiors.
然后交给了我的领导们

872
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,350
They took a look at it.
他们瞧了瞧

873
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,060
And nothing really happened.
结果没下文了

874
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:15,050
The investigation was one-sided.
调查有失公允 明显包庇

875
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,170
It all blew over. And when it did,

people I had known a long time turned their backs on me,

started spreading rumors about me.

You know, questioning my sanity and my integrity.

我开始变得偏执 易怒

880
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,720
and aggressive and drunk.
还喝得烂醉

881
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:46,990
By the time they came to me with this severance package, it was tied to an NDA.

886
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,150
poured it all down my throat.
大口灌酒把事塞回去

887
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:03,790
But I still carry a lot of guilt and shame about that time.
但我对那经历满是羞愧

888
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:06,160
And I keep thinking I was a coward.

And I was weak. I was.

I got a call from someone last night,

and broken.
无助

893
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:24,920
And I don't think he's gonna make it, honestly.
