要是搬了 系统里就有转寄地址

01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,220
It was crazy.
太艰难了

829
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,910
I figured drinking would help me to fit in
我以为喝酒能帮我合群

830
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,120
and just connect to people more.
跟人打成一片

831
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,530
And it did, a little.
确实 有一点作用

832
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:27,030
Didn't stop me getting my ass kicked all the time.
可是还是经常被人痛揍

833
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:32,360
But when that happened, it would help me go numb.

So, either way, it helped.
总之 酒是帮了我

835
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,050
And then I got a job on Wall Street.
后来去华尔街工作了

836
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,620
It was intense.

837

Drinking was part of fitting in.
喝酒也是合群的一部分

838
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,160
And it was a way of dealing

839
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:46,260
with pressure to meet these crazy targets.
变态业绩指标的压力

840

There was no way of meeting them.

I didn't wanna be a part of that.
但不想同流合污

845
01:13:57,290 --> 01:14:00,180
So, I started gathering information,

846
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,220
and I took it to my superiors.
然后交给了我的领导们

847
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,350
They took a look at it.

848
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,060
And nothing really happened.
结果没下文了

849
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:15,050
The investigation was one-sided.
调查有失公允 明显包庇

850
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,170
It all blew over. And when it did,

851
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,260
people I had known a long time turned their backs on me,

我开始变得偏执 易怒

855
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,720
and aggressive and drunk.
还喝得烂醉

856
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:46,990
By the time they came to me with this severance package, it was tied to an NDA.
公司拿着保密协议和离职补偿找我时

857
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:49,180
I was relieved.
我如释重负

858
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:52,380
