谢谢
Thank you.

63

我在团队里
I was in a team,

64
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:29,496
负责用精准育种
uh, developing a new wheat strain

65

开发一种抗虫害的新小麦品种
resistant to insect predation through precision breeding.

66
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,633
有点像基因改造
It's... It's like genetic modification,

67
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,378
不过是靠自然杂交
only it's using natural processes,

68
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:41,498
所以不受那类严格监管
so it's not subject to the same tight regulation.

总之
Anyway.

我们进展不错
We were making progress,

71
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:49,354
但后来发现对人类食物链可能有害
but we were noticing possible human food-chain issues.

72
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:51,810
有封邮件转发给我
Um, and then I was CC'ed on an e-mail chain

73
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:54,204
附件是食品安全评估
where one of the attachments was a food safety assessment

74
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:57,097
指出了明显的副作用
showing significant side effects.

75
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:59,432
向高层反映后
When I raised this issue with senior management,

76
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:02,593
他们说我理解错了
um, they told me that I'd seen the data out of context

77
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,214
叫我别担心
and not to worry.

78
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:06,767
但很快我被调走了
But then, um, soon, I was transferred

79
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,327
调到曼哈顿来了

80

做文职和数据工作

82

因为小小的打卡疏忽把我开了
I was dismissed on a minor time card violation,

现在还对我不断地骚扰

呃...
Uh...

深表同情 格兰特女士
I'm sorry to hear that, Ms. Grant.

86
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,910
他们为什么这样对您？
Why do you think this is happening?

87
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,913
我觉得...
I felt, um...

88
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:35,368
我觉得有责任把那份食品安全评估带走留证
Well, I felt I had a duty to take a copy of the food safety assessment as evidence.

89
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:38,239
您从前雇主那偷了文件？
You stole documents from your former employers?

90
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,883
偷？ 这能叫偷？
Is that... Is that stealing?

91
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:49,969
请问为什么找我们律所处理？
May I ask why you decided to discuss this issue with our firm?

92
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:52,387
有人介绍的
I followed a recommendation.

93
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,393
请问谁介绍的？
May I ask from whom?

94
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:59,283
一个朋友 不方便透露
A friend. It wouldn't be appropriate to say who.

95
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,037
格兰特女士 可以理解您的初衷
Ms. Grant, I commend you on your intentions here,

96
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:09,434
但我们早已不接这类案子
but we're no longer looking for this type of business.

97
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:14,160
有很多更专业的举报人支持机构
Uh, there are a number of highly regarded whistleblower support organizations

98
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:15,759
非常专业...
much better prepared...

99
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,141
不 我不是要揭发
No. It's not whistle blowing support I need.

100
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,901
恰恰相反
It's the opposite.

101

有谁能帮我吗？
Is there anyone who can help me?

105
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:44,519
可以找正规的专业机构 但...
Well, as I said, there are official channels, but, uh...

106
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,417
好吧...
Look, um...

107
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,831

That's kind of the point. It's a messaging service.

112
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:13,691
他们会回电
They call you back...

113
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:15,671
也可能不回
or they don't.

114
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:19,314
把实情电话里讲清楚
Just be honest about your situation.

115
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:10,499
都准备好了

最近情况更加艰难
It's been even more of a struggle recently

126
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:09,371
因为这就是我喝酒的原因

356
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:00,400
嗯？因为机场安检的事
Hm? 'Cause the airport security thing,

357
00:34:00,502 --> 00:34:02,371
它很聪明 也很紧凑
it was smart, it was tight.

358
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,002
为什么要把我们送到匹兹堡？
Why send us all the way to Pittsburgh?

把我们分开 然后让我们继续前进

365
00:34:18,718 --> 00:34:20,856
看起来它确实有效
Looks like it's fucking working.

366
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,120

如果他们联系您 请不要回应

381
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,669
他们可能会试图吓唬你 也可能会试图达成交易

382
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:14,744
但这是唯一的交易
But this is the only deal.

383
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,913
包裹到达后 我们将向他们提供报价

我们是中间人

390
00:35:39,298 --> 00:35:41,765
我们将促成一项协议 归还原始文件

“然后我们就走开 ”

396
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,884
我明白了 请说

397
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:01,983
“你的旧手机将会受到威胁 ”

398
00:36:02,086 --> 00:36:04,223
将其放入一锅盐水中

你呢？密歇根怎么样？
What about you? How's Michigan treating you?

405
00:37:26,373 --> 00:37:28,570
我猜比俄克拉荷马州的 Bumfuck 更好

我们都知道这些试验是不够的
We all knew the trials were inadequate.

818
01:12:07,485 --> 01:12:11,254
在我们了解情况之前 他们就说一切都安全了
They said things were safe way before we knew enough.

819
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,324
你知道它分布有多广
You know how widely it was distributed.

820
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:19,592
数百万人将受到影响
Millions of people will have been affected,

821
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,830
但 Optimo 会否认这一点
but Optimo will deny it.

822
01:12:23,433 --> 01:12:26,302
我本来有机会做某事 但我却搞砸了
I had a chance to do something, and I blew it.

823
01:12:28,236 --> 01:12:30,207
我的手上沾满了鲜血
I've got blood on my hands.

824
01:12:32,011 --> 01:12:35,080
这不是你的错 你帮助了我
It's not your fault. You helped me.

825
01:12:36,544 --> 01:12:40,184
谢谢 我不会再打扰你了
Thank you. I won't bother you again.

826
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:55,631
我是乔恩 我是个酒鬼
I'm Jon, and I'm an alcoholic.

827
01:12:55,733 --> 01:12:57,196
你好 乔恩
Hi, Jon.

828
01:12:57,732 --> 01:13:01,535
作为穆斯林长大 你根本不应该喝酒
Growing up Muslim, you're not supposed to drink at all.

829
01:13:02,574 --> 01:13:04,744
我 呃……
I, uh...

830
01:13:04,846 --> 01:13:07,343
所以 我是在纽约长大的穆斯林……
So, I grew up Muslim in New York...

831
01:13:08,614 --> 01:13:10,049
9/11 事件后
post 9/11.

832
01:13:10,616 --> 01:13:12,013
这太疯狂了
It was crazy.

833
01:13:12,382 --> 01:13:16,319
我认为喝酒可以帮助我融入
I figured drinking would help me to fit in

834
01:13:17,219 --> 01:13:19,388
并与人们建立更多联系
and just connect to people more.

835
01:13:20,793 --> 01:13:23,364
确实如此 有一点
And it did, a little.

836
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,765
并没有阻止我经常被踢屁股
Didn't stop me getting my ass kicked all the time.

837
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:31,906
但当这种情况发生时 它会让我变得麻木
But when that happened, it would help me go numb.

838
01:13:32,706 --> 01:13:34,708
所以 无论哪种方式 它都是有帮助的
So, either way, it helped.

839
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:38,037
然后我在华尔街找到了一份工作
And then I got a job on Wall Street.

840
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:39,678
气氛非常紧张
It was intense.

841
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,614
喝酒是融入社会的一部分
Drinking was part of fitting in.

842
01:13:41,716 --> 01:13:42,981
这是一种处理方式
And it was a way of dealing

843
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:46,146
面临着实现这些疯狂目标的压力
with pressure to meet these crazy targets.

844
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:48,252
没有办法见到他们
There was no way of meeting them.

845
01:13:49,185 --> 01:13:51,524
不违反规则
Not without bending the rules

846
01:13:51,626 --> 01:13:53,090
并欺骗别人
and screwing people over.

847
01:13:53,192 --> 01:13:55,222
尽管我很想参与其中
Much as I wanted to be a part of something,

848
01:13:55,324 --> 01:13:56,796
我不想参与其中
I didn't wanna be a part of that.

849
01:13:56,898 --> 01:14:00,094
所以我开始收集信息
So, I started gathering information,

850
01:14:00,196 --> 01:14:03,036
我把它交给了我的上级
and I took it to my superiors.

851
01:14:03,836 --> 01:14:05,401
他们看了看
They took a look at it.

852
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:09,603
但实际上什么也没发生
And nothing really happened.

853
01:14:10,943 --> 01:14:14,113
这次调查是片面的
The investigation was one- sided.

854
01:14:16,147 --> 01:14:18,084
一切都过去了 当一切过去之后
It all blew over. And when it did,

855
01:14:18,186 --> 01:14:21,017
我认识很久的人都背弃了我
people I had known a long time turned their backs on me,

856
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:24,016
开始散布关于我的谣言
started spreading rumors about me.

857
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:29,697
你知道 质疑我的理智和正直
You know, questioning my sanity and my integrity.

858
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:36,096
我开始变得偏执
And I started to become, uh, paranoid

859
01:14:36,198 --> 01:14:40,067
并且具有攻击性并且醉酒
and aggressive and drunk.

860
01:14:40,803 --> 01:14:43,873
当他们拿着遣散费来找我的时候
By the time they came to me with this severance package,

861
01:14:43,975 --> 01:14:45,639
它与保密协议有关
it was tied to an NDA.

862
01:14:47,714 --> 01:14:49,280
我松了一口气
I was relieved.

863
01:14:50,947 --> 01:14:52,452
所以 我 呃...
So, I, uh...

864
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:54,180
我拿了钱
I took the money.

865
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:55,886
我闭口不谈
I kept my mouth shut,

866
01:14:55,988 --> 01:14:57,817
把它全部灌进我的喉咙
poured it all down my throat.

867
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:03,463
但对于那段经历 我仍然感到深深的内疚和羞愧
But I still carry a lot of guilt and shame about that time.

868
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,925
我一直认为我是个懦夫
And I keep thinking I was a coward.

869
01:15:06,228 --> 01:15:08,634
我很虚弱 确实如此
And I was weak. I was.

870
01:15:09,036 --> 01:15:11,464
我昨晚接到某人的电话
I got a call from someone last night,

871
01:15:11,566 --> 01:15:16,010
他听起来很……失落……
and he just sounded so... lost...

872
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,376
并且破损
and broken.

873
01:15:20,676 --> 01:15:24,414
老实说 我认为他不会成功
And I don't think he's gonna make it, honestly.

874
01:15:26,954 --> 01:15:29,023
我不想落得这样的下场
I don't wanna end up like that.

记者或他们的读者真正关心的想法
The idea of journalists or their readers actually caring,

1005
01:28:51,252 --> 01:28:53,054
这是一个可爱、自由的幻想

1006
01:28:53,156 --> 01:28:54,825
无论如何 大多数媒体都与我们合作
Most of the media work with us anyway,

1007
01:28:54,927 --> 01:28:56,696
所以他们不会匆忙发表
so they won't publish in a hurry.

1008
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,463
社交媒体上只剩下阴谋论者了
And that leaves the conspiracy theorists on social media.

1009
01:28:59,565 --> 01:29:00,466

1013
01:29:05,066 --> 01:29:06,704
信封上贴有标签
The envelopes are labeled

1014
01:29:06,806 --> 01:29:08,402

1015
01:29:09,873 --> 01:29:11,578

including your safety copy, and we'll let her go unharmed.

1019
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:19,935
如果你表现得好的话 你也会如此
And you, too, if you behave yourself.

1020
01:29:20,018 --> 01:29:21,587
你一定是疯了
You gotta be out your fucking mind.

1021
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,215
我还有其他客户需要考虑

1022
01:29:23,317 --> 01:29:24,852

1023
01:30:59,718 --> 01:31:00,987
