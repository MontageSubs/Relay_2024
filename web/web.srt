53
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,230
都不记得还有你这号人
I don't remember you.

54
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,570
- 重要吗？ - 不重要
- Does it matter? - No.

55
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,170
挺识相的 霍夫曼
Smart decision, Hoffman.

56
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,330
我看你 挺普通的
I look at you, and you seem almost normal.

57
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,710
有点趾高气昂 但普通
Arrogant but normal.

58
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,680
本以为能见到邪恶的真面目
I thought I'd get to see what evil really looked like...

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,420
结果你和普通人没什么两样
but you just look like everyone else.

60
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,400
说完了吧？我可以走了吧？
Is that it? Can I go now?

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,220
我拿走的全都在这儿了
This is everything that I took from you.

62
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,040
我的代理会留一份用作保险
My representatives will keep one safety copy.

63
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,860
要是那帮打手还跟着我
If your thugs follow me out of here,

64
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,130
要是我出了事
if anything happens to me,

65
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,380
备份就会交给警方
that copy goes to law enforcement...

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,990
我懂 我懂
I know how this works.

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,190
还得拍张照
I need to take a picture.

68
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,330
合影
Of us.

69
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,440
来 老朋友
Two old buddies.

70
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,390
可得裱起来
Hope you frame it.

71
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,790
祝你一帆风顺
Good luck with your new life,

72
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,750
霍夫曼先生
Mr. Hoffman.

73
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,130
多谢等候
Thanks for waiting.

74
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,810
往上城开 等会儿告诉你在哪儿下
Uptown, please. I'll tell you where in a minute.

75
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,810
专属答录信箱 信箱482
Special answering service, inbox 482.

76
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,360
一条新留言
One new message.

77
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,960
那份报告拿回了
We have the report back.

78
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,680
你的款也付清了
You've been paid for your services.

79
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,270
只要霍夫曼守约 事情就到此为止
As long as Hoffman sticks to his side of the deal, we're done.

80
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,190
顺便转达下我老板的问候
And by the way, a message from my boss.

81
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,160
你个寄生的渣虫
You're parasitic scum.

82
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,880
我是霍夫曼
Hoffman here.

83
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,890
昨晚和他见面了 我已按指示交还文件
He showed last night. I handed over the documents

84
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,070
还坐火车去了波基普西
and took the train to Poughkeepsie as instructed.

85
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,700
希望你那份备份
I hope the safety copy is enough

86
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,240
能让奥蒂莫制药别再来找咱们麻烦
to keep Optimo off my back and yours.

87
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,770
你的那半已经寄了
I sent the other half of the money to the address you provided.

88
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,110
没想到和解款这么多
I wasn't expecting so much myself.

89
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,670
我还以为他们该付给你的钱也给我了 谢谢了
I thought that would go for your fee. Thank you.

90
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,780
他们真会守约吗？
Are they gonna play fair?

91
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,770
格兰特女士
Ms. Grant?

92
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,030
你好 我是朱莉
Hi. I'm Julie.

93
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,580
- 你好 - 莫雷尔律师现在可以见您了
- Hi. - Mr. Morel will see you now.

94
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,730
谢谢
Thank you.

95
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,640
我在团队里
I was in a team,

96
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,500
负责用精确育种
uh, developing a new wheat strain

97
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,140
开发一种抗虫害的新小麦品种
resistant to insect predation through precision breeding.

98
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,630
有点像基因改造
It's... It's like genetic modification,

99
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,380
不过是靠自然杂交
only it's using natural processes,

100
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,500
所以不受那类严格监管
so it's not subject to the same tight regulation.

101
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,650
总之
Anyway.

102
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,920
我们进展不错
We were making progress,

103
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,350
但后来发现其对人类食物链可能有害
but we were noticing possible human food-chain issues.

104
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,810
有封邮件抄送给我
Um, and then I was CC'ed on an e-mail chain

105
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,200
附件里有一份食品安全评估
where one of the attachments was a food safety assessment

106
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,100
指出产品有明显的不良反应
showing significant side effects.

107
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,430
我向高层反映后
When I raised this issue with senior management,

108
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,590
他们说我理解错了
um, they told me that I'd seen the data out of context

109
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,210
叫我别担心
and not to worry.

110
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,770
但很快我被调走了
But then, um, soon, I was transferred

111
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,330
调到曼哈顿来了
to another department here in Manhattan.

112
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,410
做文职和数据工作
Office work, data assessment.

113
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,970
两个月后
Um, and then, two months later,

114
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,520
因为小小的打卡疏忽 他们就把我开了
I was dismissed on a minor time card violation,

115
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,550
现在还对我不断地骚扰
and now I'm being subjected to escalating harassment.

116
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,130
呃...
Uh...

117
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,140
深表同情 格兰特女士
I'm sorry to hear that, Ms. Grant.

118
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,910
他们为什么这样对您？
Why do you think this is happening?

119
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,910
我觉得...
I felt, um...

120
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,370
我觉得有责任把那份评估报告带走留证
Well, I felt I had a duty to take a copy of the food safety assessment as evidence.

121
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,240
您从前雇主那偷了文件？
You stole documents from your former employers?

122
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,880
偷？ 这能叫偷？
Is that... Is that stealing?

123
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,970
请问为什么找我们律所处理？
May I ask why you decided to discuss this issue with our firm?

124
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,390
有人介绍的
I followed a recommendation.

125
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,390
请问谁介绍的？
May I ask from whom?

126
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,280
一个朋友 不方便透露
A friend. It wouldn't be appropriate to say who.

127
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,040
格兰特女士 可以理解您的初衷
Ms. Grant, I commend you on your intentions here,

128
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,430
但我们早已不接这类案子
but we're no longer looking for this type of business.

129
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,160
有很多更专业的机构 能帮助你揭发内幕
Uh, there are a number of highly regarded whistleblower support organizations

130
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,760
非常专业...
much better prepared...

131
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,140
不 我不是要揭发
No. It's not whistle blowing support I need.

132
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,900
恰恰相反
It's the opposite.

133
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,130
我只想把文件都还回去
I just want to give everything back

134
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,350
保证守口如瓶 回到正常生活
and promise to keep my mouth shut and get on with my life.

135
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,630
请帮帮我 帮帮我
Please. Please.

136
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,840
有谁能帮我吗？
Is there anyone who can help me?

137
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,520
可以找正规的专业机构 但...
Well, as I said, there are official channels, but, uh...

138
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,420
好吧...
Look, um...

139
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,830
我们也会把人介绍给非正式渠道
There are unofficial ones we've referred people to in the past.

140
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,020
给你这个号码 也许能帮上忙
Just take this number, and maybe they can help you.

141
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,370
这是谁？
Who is he?

142
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,940
没见过他 也可能是她 或者一群人
I've never met him, or her or they.

143
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,650
匿名才是重点 那只是个传话服务
That's kind of the point. It's a messaging service.

144
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,690
他们会回电
They call you back...

145
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,670
也可能不回
or they don't.

146
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,310
把实情电话里讲清楚
Just be honest about your situation.

147
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
都准备好了
You are all set.

148
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,850
楼下大堂24小时有人 有需要随时打电话
The lobby's attended 24 hours a day. Call if you need anything.

149
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,830
多谢这么快就安排好了
Thanks for doing this on short notice.

150
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,130
该做的 住得舒心
That's what we do. Enjoy your stay.

151
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,890
大家好 我叫沃什 我有酒瘾
Hey, I'm Wash, and I'm an alcoholic.

152
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,780
- 你好 沃什 - 欢迎你

153

我戒酒已有九年零九个月了
I've been sober nine years, nine months.

154
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,410
但...
And...

155
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,670
但最近特难熬
It's been even more of a struggle recently

156
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,640
老诱因又来了
because there's why I drank in the first place,

157
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,000
加上工作中乱七八糟的事
and then there's me doing what I do.

158
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,180
毕竟我以当警察为荣
'Cause I'm proud of serving on the force.

159
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,610
我也尽量按规矩办事
And I stay on the up and up.

160
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,510
差不多是这样
Pretty much.

161
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,780
但...
But, um...

162
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,020
我每天看到同事们那样做事儿...
What I see on the daily, amongst my fellow officers...

163
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,720
真 真无语
I... I... I don't know.

206
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,130
新品种照常生产
Production of the new strain has gone ahead,

207
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,940
报告被压了下去

没有这份报告

218
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,610
就不可能把病因追溯到食品上
it will be impossible to trace it back to the food people have eaten.

219
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,250
“您的文件能证明他们的不法行为吗？”
"Would you say this document contains clear evidence of malfeasance?"

220
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,310
比起他们造假的报告 这份是铁证如山

别想让我再坐你们的飞机了
I'm never flying your airline again.

338
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,460
- 她人呢？ - 没见到
- Where is she? - No-show.

339
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,890
广播一直叫她 但她没来
They keep calling her name. She didn't show up.

340
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,720

They're not following her.

345
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,500
这话啥意思？
What do you mean?

346
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,760
我们暴露了
We're made.

347
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,140
- 你在哪里？- 你猜不到的
- Where are you? - You won't believe it,

348
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,090
她在邮局窗口

359
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,370
机场那套布得真巧 环环相扣
Hm? 'Cause the airport security thing, it was smart, it was tight.

360
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,250
干嘛要大费周折去匹兹堡？
Why send us all the way to Pittsburgh?

361
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,650
2001年后运输安全管理局几乎
Since 2001, the TSA has closed over 113 airport branches

362
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,720
关掉了所有机场邮局
of the United States Post Office.

363
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,710
只有匹兹堡的还在安检后
The only one remaining inside security is Pittsburgh.

364
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,800
好 所以分开寄到了两个信箱
All right. So, there's two P.O. Box addresses.

365
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,820
把我们分开 逼我们不停奔波
Split us up and keep us running.

366
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,630
这招真是机灵到家了
Looks like it's fucking working.

367
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,750
对 对
Yep. Yep.

368
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,300
你猜我怎么看？
You know what I think?

369
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,200
我喜欢这单
I think I like this one.

370
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,050
乌拉
Hoorah.

371
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,420
遇到个狡猾的对手
They're smarter than we thought.

372
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,600
嘿 把运单号给我下
Hey, do you have those tracking numbers for me?

373
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,420
- 给你 - 查下我们去哪儿奔波

“他们找您也别回应”
Do not respond if they contact you.

382
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,750
“他们可能恐吓您 也可能想谈交易易”
They may try to scare you, and they may try to make a deal.

383
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,770
“我是您唯一的出路”
But this is the only deal.

384
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,000
“包裹一到 我们会跟他们谈判”
Once the packages arrive, we will make them an offer.

385
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,610
“那之后您要见面他们一次 把东西还回去”
"You're going to meet them once to make the return yourself."

386
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,180
非得去吗？请传达

388
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,130

"You will never meet us. We are not bodyguards."

390
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,280

We are intermediaries.

391
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,850
“我们会安排归还原件事宜”
We will broker a deal to return the original documents

392
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,520
“同时留一份备份做保险”

393

00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,370
祝您晚上愉快
Have a wonderful night.

402
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,950
喂 摄像头我装好了
Hey. Yeah. I got a camera in position.

403
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,710
但一无所获
But I don't got nothing.

404
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,340
你呢？密歇根那边怎样？
What about you? How's Michigan treating you?

405
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,770
我猜比你那鸟不拉屎的地方好
I'm guessing better than Bumfuck, Oklahoma.

406
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,740
- 哈哈 可不是么 - 这儿环境可好了
- Damn. - It's really pretty.

407
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,720
- 您好 - 嗨 我来替朋友阿奇取个邮件
- Hi. - Hi. I wanna pick up a package for my friend Archie.

408
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,440
521号信箱
He's got box 521.

409
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,110
我有运单号 但钥匙忘带了
I have the tracking number, but I forgot the key.

410
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,830
能麻烦帮我拿一下吗？
Would you be able just to grab it for me?

411
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,600
抱歉 女士 我们有规定
Well, I'm afraid, ma'am, that regulations do not permit me

412
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,620
不能帮客户开信箱
to open mailboxes for our clients.

413
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,790
- 哦 不会吧 - 没办法
- Oh, no. Really? - Sorry.

414
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,610
都怪我 我不该忘带那破钥匙
It's my fault. Should've remembered the darn key.

415
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,730
嗯
Yeah.

416
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,920
只 只是我家狗病得很重
Just... My dog is really sick.

417
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,470
- 哦 - 现在脑袋一片浆糊
- Oh. - Yeah. My head is a mess.

418
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,790
对 对不起
I... I'm sorry.

419
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,880
- 是啊 挺遗憾的 - 嗯
- Well, that's a shame, ma'am. - Yeah.

420
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,890
是啊 年纪大了 老姑娘了
She's just a... tired old girl.

421
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,410
- 唉 - 撑不了多久了
- Aw. - Won't be too much longer now.

422
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,570
能不能麻烦您帮我看下包裹到没到？
I don't suppose you'd be able to just check to see if the package has arrived?

423
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,490
哦 呃...
Oh. Um...

424
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,570
好 我去看下
Uh, okay.

425
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,450
- 麻烦啦 - 请稍等
- Thank you. - You wait here.

426
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,840
抱歉 女士 信箱是空的
I'm sorry, ma'am. There's nothing there.

427
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,770
特快的 应该早到了
Well, it was sent Priority Mail. It should have already arrived.

428
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,190
抱歉
I'm sorry.

429
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,060
哦 好吧
Huh. Okay.

430
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,660
今天真不顺
Not a good day.

431
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,480
你朋友最近搬家了吗？
Did your friend recently move, by any chance?

432
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,820
要是搬了 系统里就有转寄地址
If they did, there would be a forwarding address on file,

433
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,870
包裹被转错的话就会晚到
and if it was rerouted, well, that could explain the delay.

434
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,760
对 有转寄
Yes. Mail forwarding.

435
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,590
天呐 这说得通了
Oh, my gosh. That makes total sense.

436
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,620
他刚搬过来
He just moved here, actually.

437
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,130
麻烦问一下
Can you tell me something?

438
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,190
旧运单号上会显示新目的地吗？
Will the new destination show up on that old tracking number?

439
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,500
是这样的
Now, there's the thing.

440
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,140
运单信息不一定更新转寄信息
Tracking does not always carry over to forwarding

441
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,130
那是两个不同的系统
because they're different services.

442
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,490
“富兰克林先生 请注意”
"This is a message for Mr. Franklin.

443

It is 311 pages long and contains two appendices.

447

“只要你们无条件承诺别再骚扰她”
In exchange for your unconditional agreement to leave her alone,

“并保证永不提及”
"and agree never to mention it again."

450

722
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,650
还买点别的吗？
Just that?

723
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,740
能给你拍张照吗？我们在做个项目
Could I get your photo? Doing this thing on New Yorkers

724
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,730
记录纽约人日常生活 拍一下吧
in their natural habitat. You know what I'm saying?

725
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,660
拍一下吧
Come on!

726
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,700
照你指示 塞到最左边那堆了
I left it in the Post, bottom copy, left pile like you said.

727
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:56,260
“《华盛顿邮报》是左起第二堆”
"The Washington Post is second from the left."

728
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,210
左起第二堆吗
Second from the left.

729
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:01,530
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

730
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:06,170
太匆忙了 我这就去重新放
Everything happened so fast. Um, I'll come back for it.

731
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,590
“太迟了 你知道有人在跟踪你吗？”
"It'll be gone by then. Did you know you were being followed?"

732
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,550
不知道 我以为那帮人停手了
No. I thought they stopped that.

733
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,470
真的很抱歉 是我的错
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.

734
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,440
别撒手啊
Don't walk away.

735
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,340
今天老娘过生日 贱人
It's my birthday, bitch!

736
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,790
过生日 要吃糖
It's my birthday, and I'm getting candy!

737
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,940
老娘还要买彩票
And give me some goddamn lottery tickets, too.

738
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:00,350
放 放回去 别 该死
Put the... Put the candy... Fuck.

739
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,750
嘿！站住！站住！
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

740
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:24,030
拿到了吗？拿到了吗？谢谢你
Did you get it? Did you get it? Thank you.

741
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:28,290
嘿！嘿 嘿！在哪？在哪儿？
Hey! Hey, hey! Where is it? Where is it?

742
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,550
住手 你搞什么鬼
What the fuck, man?

743
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,070
你把它放哪了？
Where'd you put it?

744
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:39,740
看 这就是他 装成保安
That's him right there. Security guard.

745
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,680
真没想到
No shit.

746
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:43,670
就是这个人
It's this guy right here.

747
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:46,740
我当时坐那儿 盯着西装男
I'm sitting there, I'm watching the guy in the fucking suit.

748
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,570
那混蛋就在跟前
And this bastard is right there.

749
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:50,380
对 你有印象吗？
Yeah, you remember him?

750
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,570
喂
Yeah.

751
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:58,180
大都会传呼中心 有人通过传呼跟您通话
A person is calling through the Tri-State Relay Service.

752
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,370
您接过传呼电话吗？
Have you received a call from us before?

753
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,370
有的 等一下
Yes, we have. Just give me one second, please.

754
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,510
嘿 醒醒 传呼电话
Hey, yo. Hey, hey. TTY.

"We've got 40 copies, including the missing appendix,"

757
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,940
“准备曝光给各家媒体”
ready to go to spread across the mainstream and alternative media.

758
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,260
“你们答应过不再跟踪和骚扰她”
"You agreed to stop following and harassing her."

759
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,850
她在时报广场
She was in Times Square

760
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,410
拿着那份敏感文件到处跑
with a document that contains sensitive material.

761
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:33,000
“没跟踪怎么会知道她去哪里”
You wouldn't know that if you weren't following her.

762
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:34,860
“要我们曝光吗？”
"Do you want us to go public?"

763
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,020
我们道歉 抱歉 我们错了
We apologize. We're sorry. We made a mistake.

764
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,600
今后完全照办 请传达
And we'll do exactly as you say from now on. Go ahead.

765
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,890
“交接由我们的客户和”
"The handover will be between our client"

766
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:45,100
“你们的CEO富兰克林当面完成”
and your CEO, Franklin, in person,

767
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:49,880
“时间是周四晚七点 地点我们定 在公共场所”
"in a public place of our choice at 7 p.m. on Thursday."

768
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:51,750
富总出差了
Mr. Franklin is out of town.

769
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:54,440
那就叫他回来
Well, get him back.

770
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:56,040
“请他回来”
"Ask him to return."

771
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,370
尽力安排
Oh, yeah. I'll try my best.

772
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:59,380
周四正好是证监会敲定前一天
Thursday is the day before the SEC filing.

773
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,010
卡得太紧 请传达

774
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:02,700
“就看你们了”

776
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,300
感谢使用大...
Thank you for using...

777
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:09,490
- 行了 - 拍到他了
- That's it. - We got our guy.

778
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,250
这是他
That's him.

779
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:13,520
让政府情报中心的朋友处理这图
We'll get him to our friends at a fusion center.

780
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,140
跑人脸识别？不够清楚吧
For facial recognition? I don't think it's good enough.

781
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,850
拍到最好的就这张了
That's the best frame of his face we have.

782
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,570
已为您接通
Your call is now connected.

783
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:32,150
你 你还好吧？请传达
Are you all right? Go ahead.

784
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,240
你 你还...
Uh, are you th...

785
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,030
你还在吗？
Are you there?

786
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,280
请讲
Hello?

787
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:54,870
“文件我们已拿到  交接定在周四”
"We have it. We're setting the exchange for Thursday."

788
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,590
“在那之前 您每天打一次电话”
Until then, you'll call each day once

789
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,270
“只留一句话”
and leave a message.

790
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:02,990
“说「一切安好」或「天气」”
You'll say, 'All right, ' or you'll say, 'Weather.'

791
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:04,580
“别再多嘴”
Nothing more.

792
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,510
“照我们指示做”
You'll follow instructions because this time,

793
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:11,310
“否则我们就撒手 懂吗？”
"we will walk away. Do you understand?"

794
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:12,450
懂
Yes.

795
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:16,960
- 请传达 - 来电者已挂断
- Go ahead. - Your caller has hung up.

796
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,540
感谢使用大都会传呼
Thank you for using the Tri-State Relay Service.

797
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:21,110
祝您晚上愉快
Have a wonderful night.

798
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:49,810
你好 麻烦订个位
Hey. Um, I'd like to book a table, please.

799
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,360
最后地点在贝尔
We tracked it as far as Bell.

800
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:57,380
那儿是个全国物流中心
There's a national distribution center there.

801
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:59,270
之后就没信号了
Then we lost it.

802
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:02,070
信号还回得来吗？
Will the signal come back?

803
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:05,040
里头没有备用电池
There were no backup batteries.

804
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,840
接下来会往哪寄？
Where's it gonna go from there?

805
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,950
全国各地到处都有可能
It could literally be anywhere.

806
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:32,690
一切安好
All right.

807
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,510
一切安好
All right.

808
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,270
我是霍夫曼
It's Hoffman.

809
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,280
我一直在翻那些参加了
I've been checking the obituaries of the towns

810
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,830
奥蒂莫试验城镇的讣告
that were part of Optimo's trials.

811
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:59,350
健康年轻人接二连三地死去
Healthy young people suddenly dying.

812
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,080
还有多少没被发现的？
How many more are there?

813
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,590
内部都明白这些试验不严谨
We all knew the trials were inadequate.

814
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:11,380
还没弄清楚前 公司就说一切安全了
They said things were safe way before we knew enough.

815
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:16,050
你知道覆盖面有多广吗
You know how widely it was distributed.

816
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,470
上百万人会受影响
Millions of people will have been affected,

817
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:23,570
可奥蒂莫会否认一切
but Optimo will deny it.

818
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,730
我本有机会揭发的 给浪费了
I had a chance to do something, and I blew it.

819
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,750
我手上沾满了血
I've got blood on my hands.

820
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:36,730
这不是你的错 你只是帮忙的
It's not your fault. You helped me.

821
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:40,710
谢谢你 我不会再来打扰了
Thank you. I won't bother you again.

822
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,710
我叫乔恩 我有酒瘾
I'm Jon, and I'm an alcoholic.

823
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:57,390
欢迎 乔恩
Hi, Jon.

824
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:02,080
我打小就是穆斯林 按规矩根本不能喝酒
Growing up Muslim, you're not supposed to drink at all.

825
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,540
我...
I, uh...

826
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,470
我作为穆斯林 在911后的纽约...
So, I grew up Muslim in New York...

827
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,260
长大
post 9/11.

828
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,220
太艰难了
It was crazy.

829
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,910
我以为喝酒能帮我合群
I figured drinking would help me to fit in

830
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,120
跟人打成一片
and just connect to people more.

831
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,530
确实 有一点作用
And it did, a little.

832
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:27,030
可是还是经常被人痛揍
Didn't stop me getting my ass kicked all the time.

833
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:32,360
被打的时候 喝酒能麻痹痛苦
But when that happened, it would help me go numb.

834
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,790
总之 酒是帮了我
So, either way, it helped.

835
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,050
后来去华尔街工作了
And then I got a job on Wall Street.

836
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,620
工作强度非常高
It was intense.

837
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,720
喝酒也是合群的一部分
Drinking was part of fitting in.

838
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,160
也用来应付那些
And it was a way of dealing

839
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:46,260
变态业绩指标的压力
with pressure to meet these crazy targets.

840
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,210
根本不可能完成那些指标
There was no way of meeting them.

841
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,400
除非违反规则
Not without bending the rules

842
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,240
坑害别人
and screwing people over.

843
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,370
我确实想融入什么
Much as I wanted to be a part of something,

844
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,270
但不想同流合污
I didn't wanna be a part of that.

845
01:13:57,290 --> 01:14:00,180
所以我开始搜集证据
So, I started gathering information,

846
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,220
然后交给了我的领导们
and I took it to my superiors.

847
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,350
他们瞧了瞧
They took a look at it.

848
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,060
结果没下文了
And nothing really happened.

849
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:15,050
调查有失公允 明显包庇
The investigation was one-sided.

850
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,170
事一平息
It all blew over. And when it did,

851
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,260
那些老相识都背离我
people I had known a long time turned their backs on me,

852
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,270
到处传我的坏话
started spreading rumors about me.

853
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:29,850
他们开始怀疑我的头脑和人品
You know, questioning my sanity and my integrity.

854
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:36,180
我开始变得偏执 易怒
And I started to become, uh, paranoid

855
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,720
还喝得烂醉
and aggressive and drunk.

856
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:46,990
公司拿着保密协议和离职补偿找我时
By the time they came to me with this severance package, it was tied to an NDA.

857
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:49,180
我如释重负
I was relieved.

858

You're going to do what we say now. You understand?

995
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:43,740
放了她 行不？
Listen, let her go. All right?

996
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,320
不然所有的文件都会曝光  听见没？
The documents are going out, all of them. You hear me?

997
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:48,830
那又怎样？
And then what, huh?

998
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:51,230
指望记者或读者关心？
The idea of journalists or their readers actually caring,

999
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,140
可爱又幼稚的幻想
it's a cute, liberal fantasy.

1000
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,310
多数媒体跟我们合作
Most of the media work with us anyway,

1001
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,050
不会急着发
so they won't publish in a hurry.

1002
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:59,460
只能发网上当谣言了
And that leaves the conspiracy theorists on social media.

1003
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:00,390
祝好运
Good luck with that.

1004
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:03,500
执法机关可是火眼金睛
Guess what. Law enforcement is gonna be reading more closely,

1005
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:04,950
别想惹我 懂吗？
so don't fucking push me, all right?

1006
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:07,380
信封都封好了
The envelopes are labeled and sealed.

1007
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,850

- All right? - Here's the deal.

1008
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:14,390
我们跟你去藏文件的地方
We're gonna come with you to wherever you keep your documents,

1009
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:16,360
你把所有副本交给我们
and you're gonna give us all the copies of the report,

1010
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,460
包括保险备份 她就能平安无事
including your safety copy, and we'll let her go unharmed.

1011
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,000
你听话也能保住命
And you, too, if you behave yourself.

1012
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,470
你们王八蛋想什么的？
You gotta be out your fucking mind.

1013
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,550
我不能危及别的客户
I have other clients to consider.

1014
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,330
你真以为你还有得选？
You really think you have a choice?

1015
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:00,800
说
Yeah?

1016
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:04,180
行 我照办
Yeah, I'll do it.

1017
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,400
带你们去拿所有档案
I'll take you to all the records. I'll do it.

1018
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:08,400
好 很好
That's good. That's very good.

1019
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:12,490
明早天一亮 到你客户的公寓来
Dawn tomorrow, you come to your client's apartment.

Sarah, you okay?

1021
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,210

I'm fine.

1022

你放了她 我就说
You let her go, I'll tell you.

1024
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:35,730
别打了
Stop.

1025
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,400
想拿文件就得让我们俩都活着
You want the documents, you need us both alive.

1026
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:40,950
先放了她 我们好好谈
So, why don't you let her go, and we'll talk.

1027
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,700
用不着她
Don't really need her.

1028

这是闹哪出啊？
What is this?

1075
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:49,950
我有一堆文件 能证明奥蒂莫的药
I got documents that show Optimo Pharmaceutical's products

1076
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:51,820
有不良反应 他们明明知情
have adverse effects, and they knew about it.

1077
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,160
还故意掩盖
They tried to cover up the evidence.

1078
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,780

This is what I do. I help people who find things like this.

1083
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:03,490
那些看到不该看
Who see things maybe they shouldn't have,

1084
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:06,180
却没法再装作没看见的人
who should have looked the other way, but they can't.

1085
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,490
我得把这些交给我信得过的人
Now I gotta turn it over to somebody I trust.

1086
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:14,960
