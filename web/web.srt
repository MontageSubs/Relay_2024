负责用精确育种
uh, developing a new wheat strain

开发一种抗虫害的新小麦品种
resistant to insect predation through precision breeding.

71
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,630
有点像基因改造
It's... It's like genetic modification,

72
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,380
不过是靠自然杂交
only it's using natural processes,

73
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,500
所以不受那类严格监管
so it's not subject to the same tight regulation.

总之
Anyway.

我们进展不错
We were making progress,

76
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,350
但后来发现对人类食物链可能有害
but we were noticing possible human food-chain issues.

77
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,810
有封邮件转发给我
Um, and then I was CC'ed on an e-mail chain

78
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,200
附件是食品安全评估
where one of the attachments was a food safety assessment

79
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,100
指出了明显的副作用
showing significant side effects.

80
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,430
向高层反映后
When I raised this issue with senior management,

81
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,590
他们说我理解错了
um, they told me that I'd seen the data out of context

82
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,210
叫我别担心
and not to worry.

83
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,770
但很快我被调走了
But then, um, soon, I was transferred

84
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,330
调到曼哈顿来了
to another department here in Manhattan.

85
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,410
做文职和数据工作

两个月后
Um, and then, two months later,

87
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,520
因为小小的打卡疏忽把我开了
I was dismissed on a minor time card violation,

88
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,550
现在还对我不断地骚扰
and now I'm being subjected to escalating harassment.

呃...
Uh...

深表同情 格兰特女士
I'm sorry to hear that, Ms. Grant.

91
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,910
他们为什么这样对您？
Why do you think this is happening?

92
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,910
我觉得...
I felt, um...

93
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,370
我觉得有责任把那份评估报告带走留证
Well, I felt I had a duty to take a copy of the food safety assessment as evidence.

94
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,240
您从前雇主那偷了文件？
You stole documents from your former employers?

偷？ 这能叫偷？
Is that... Is that stealing?

96
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,970
请问为什么找我们律所处理？
May I ask why you decided to discuss this issue with our firm?

97
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,390
有人介绍的
I followed a recommendation.

请问谁介绍的？
May I ask from whom?

99
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,280
一个朋友 不方便透露
A friend. It wouldn't be appropriate to say who.

100
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,040
格兰特女士 可以理解您的初衷
Ms. Grant, I commend you on your intentions here,

101
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,430
但我们早已不接这类案子
but we're no longer looking for this type of business.

102
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,160
有很多更专业的举报人支持机构
Uh, there are a number of highly regarded whistleblower support organizations

103
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,760
非常专业...
much better prepared...

104
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,140
不 我不是要揭发
No. It's not whistle blowing support I need.

105
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,900
恰恰相反
It's the opposite.

106
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,130

有谁能帮我吗？
Is there anyone who can help me?

110
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,520
可以找正规的专业机构 但...
Well, as I said, there are official channels, but, uh...

111
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,420
好吧...
Look, um...

112
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,830
我们也会把人介绍给非正式渠道
There are unofficial ones we've referred people to in the past.

Just take this number, and maybe they can help you.

I've never met him, or her or they.

116
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,650
匿名才是重点，那只是个传话服务
That's kind of the point. It's a messaging service.

117
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,690
他们会回电
They call you back...

118
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,670
也可能不回
or they don't.

119
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,310
把实情电话里讲清楚
Just be honest about your situation.

120
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
都准备好了

130
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,000
加上工作中乱七八糟的事

没有吧
I don't think so.

162
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,990
来电者可能有听力障碍
The person who has called you is likely to be deaf or hard of hearing.

我在一个项目里 研究抗虫小麦新品种
I was in a research group developing a new strain of insect-resistant wheat.

178
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,560
有份食品安全报告出来

向上级报告后
I told my bosses.

181
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,530
结果我被调走
Next thing I knew, I'd been reassigned

182
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,090
后来干脆被开除了
and later dismissed.

183
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,130
新品种照常生产
Production of the new strain has gone ahead,

184
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,940
报告被压了下去
but these findings have been suppressed.

185
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:30,390
我设法留了份报告副本
Um, but I was able to get a copy of that food safety report out of the building.

Go ahead.

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,770
“什么副作用？”
"You mention side effects."

189
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,630
个别案例里有

195
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,060
没有这份报告
But without the information I have,

196
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,610
就不可能把病因追溯到食品上
it will be impossible to trace it back to the food people have eaten.

197
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,250
“您的文件能证明他们的不法行为吗？”
"Would you say this document contains clear evidence of malfeasance?"

198
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,310
比起他们造假的报告 这份是铁证如山
Compared to the fraudulent version of their report, yes.

199
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,540
请传达
Go ahead.

200
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,170
“他们给钱收买您吗？”
"Did they offer you a cash settlement in exchange for your silence?"

201
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,750
起初他们想 但我没接受
Um, initially, yes, but I wasn't interested.

202
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,500
我想揭发真相
I wanted to do the right thing.

203
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,070
然后他们开始威胁我

- 您好 - 嗨 我来替朋友阿奇取个邮件
- Hi. - Hi. I wanna pick up a package for my friend Archie.

405
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,440
521号信箱
He's got box 521.

406
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,110
我有运单号 但钥匙忘带了
I have the tracking number, but I forgot the key.

407
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,830
能麻烦帮我拿一下吗？
Would you be able just to grab it for me?

408
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,600
抱歉 女士 我们有规定
Well, I'm afraid, ma'am, that regulations do not permit me

409
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,620
不能帮客户开信箱
to open mailboxes for our clients.

410
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,790
- 哦 不会吧 - 没办法
- Oh, no. Really? - Sorry.

411
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,610
都怪我 我不该忘带那破钥匙
It's my fault. Should've remembered the darn key.

412
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,730
嗯
Yeah.

413
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,920
只 只是我家狗病得很重
Just... My dog is really sick.

414
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,470
- 哦 - 现在脑袋一片浆糊
- Oh. - Yeah. My head is a mess.

415
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,790
对 对不起
I... I'm sorry.

416
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,880
- 是啊 挺遗憾的 - 嗯
- Well, that's a shame, ma'am. - Yeah.

417
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,890
是啊 年纪大了 老姑娘了
She's just a... tired old girl.

418
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,410
- 唉 - 撑不了多久了
- Aw. - Won't be too much longer now.

419
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,570
能不能麻烦您帮我看下包裹到没到？
I don't suppose you'd be able to just check to see if the package has arrived?

420
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,490
哦 呃...
Oh. Um...

421
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,570
好 我去看下
Uh, okay.

422
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,450
- 麻烦啦 - 请稍等
- Thank you. - You wait here.

423
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,840
抱歉 女士 信箱是空的
I'm sorry, ma'am. There's nothing there.

424
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,770
特快的 应该早到了
Well, it was sent Priority Mail. It should have already arrived.

425
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,190
抱歉
I'm sorry.

426
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,060
哦 好吧
Huh. Okay.

427
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,660
今天真不顺
Not a good day.

428
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,480
你朋友最近搬家了吗？
Did your friend recently move, by any chance?

429
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,820
要是搬了 系统里就有转寄地址
If they did, there would be a forwarding address on file,

430
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,870
包裹被转错的话就会晚到
and if it was rerouted, well, that could explain the delay.

431
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,760
对 有转寄
Yes. Mail forwarding.

432
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,590
天呐 这说得通了
Oh, my gosh. That makes total sense.

433
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,620
他刚搬过来
He just moved here, actually.

434
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,130
麻烦问一下
Can you tell me something?

435
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,190
旧运单号上显示新目的地吗？
Will the new destination show up on that old tracking number?

436
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,500
是这样的
Now, there's the thing.

437
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,140
运单信息不一定更新转寄信息
Tracking does not always carry over to forwarding

438
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,130
那是两个不同的系统
because they're different services.

而已
Nothing more.

809
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,860
你会遵循指示 因为这一次
You'll follow instructions because this time,

810
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:10,740
“我们会走开 你明白吗？”
"we will walk away. Do you understand?"

811
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,400
是的
Yes.

812
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,840
—请继续 —您的来电者已挂断
- Go ahead. - Your caller has hung up.

813
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:19,510
感谢您使用三态中继服务
Thank you for using the Tri-State Relay Service.

814
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:21,150
祝您度过一个美好的夜晚
Have a wonderful night.

815
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:49,810
嘿 嗯 我想预订一张桌子
Hey. Um, I'd like to book a table, please.

816
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,280
我们一直追踪到贝尔
We tracked it as far as Bell.

817
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:57,380
那里有一个国家配送中心
There's a national distribution center there.

818
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,790
然后我们就失去了它
Then we lost it.

819
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:01,720
信号会恢复吗？
Will the signal come back?

820
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:04,420
没有备用电池
There were no backup batteries.

821
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,450
接下来它会去哪里？
Where's it gonna go from there?

822
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,520
它实际上可能在任何地方
It could literally be anywhere.

823
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:32,790
好的
All right.

824
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,490
好的
All right.

825
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,270
是霍夫曼
It's Hoffman.

826
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,200
我一直在查看各个城镇的讣告
I've been checking the obituaries of the towns

827
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,910
这是 Optimo 试验的一部分
that were part of Optimo's trials.

828
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:59,340
健康的年轻人突然死亡
Healthy young people suddenly dying.

829
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,980
还有多少？
How many more are there?

830
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:06,780
我们都知道这些试验是不够的
We all knew the trials were inadequate.

831
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:11,250
在我们了解情况之前 他们就说一切都安全了
They said things were safe way before we knew enough.

832
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,320
你知道它分布有多广
You know how widely it was distributed.

833
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,590
数百万人将受到影响
Millions of people will have been affected,

834
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,830
但 Optimo 会否认这一点
but Optimo will deny it.

835
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,300
我本来有机会做某事 但我却搞砸了
I had a chance to do something, and I blew it.

836
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,210
我的手上沾满了鲜血
I've got blood on my hands.

837
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:35,080
这不是你的错 你帮助了我
It's not your fault. You helped me.

838
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:40,180
谢谢 我不会再打扰你了
Thank you. I won't bother you again.

839
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,630
我是乔恩 我是个酒鬼
I'm Jon, and I'm an alcoholic.

840
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:57,200
你好 乔恩
Hi, Jon.

841
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:01,540
作为穆斯林长大 你根本不应该喝酒
Growing up Muslim, you're not supposed to drink at all.

842
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,740
我 呃……
I, uh...

843
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,340
所以 我是在纽约长大的穆斯林……
So, I grew up Muslim in New York...

844
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:10,050
9/11 事件后
post 9/11.

845
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,010
这太疯狂了
It was crazy.

846
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:16,320
我认为喝酒可以帮助我融入
I figured drinking would help me to fit in

847
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,390
并与人们建立更多联系
and just connect to people more.

848
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,360
确实如此 有一点
And it did, a little.

849
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,770
并没有阻止我经常被踢屁股
Didn't stop me getting my ass kicked all the time.

850
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:31,910
但当这种情况发生时 它会让我变得麻木
But when that happened, it would help me go numb.

851
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:34,710
所以 无论哪种方式 它都是有帮助的
So, either way, it helped.

852
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:38,040
然后我在华尔街找到了一份工作
And then I got a job on Wall Street.

853
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,680
气氛非常紧张
It was intense.

854
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,610
喝酒是融入社会的一部分
Drinking was part of fitting in.

855
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,980
这是一种处理方式
And it was a way of dealing

856
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,150
面临着实现这些疯狂目标的压力
with pressure to meet these crazy targets.

857
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,250
没有办法见到他们
There was no way of meeting them.

858
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,520
不违反规则
Not without bending the rules

859
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,090
并欺骗别人
and screwing people over.

860
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,220
尽管我很想参与其中
Much as I wanted to be a part of something,

861
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,800
我不想参与其中
I didn't wanna be a part of that.

862
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,090
所以我开始收集信息
So, I started gathering information,

863
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,040
我把它交给了我的上级
and I took it to my superiors.

864
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,400
他们看了看
They took a look at it.

865
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,600
但实际上什么也没发生
And nothing really happened.

866
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:14,110
这次调查是片面的
The investigation was one- sided.

867
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,080
一切都过去了 当一切过去之后
It all blew over. And when it did,

868
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,020
我认识很久的人都背弃了我
people I had known a long time turned their backs on me,

869
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,020
开始散布关于我的谣言
started spreading rumors about me.

870
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:29,700
你知道 质疑我的理智和正直
You know, questioning my sanity and my integrity.

871
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:36,100
我开始变得偏执
And I started to become, uh, paranoid

872
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,070
并且具有攻击性并且醉酒
and aggressive and drunk.

873
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,870
当他们拿着遣散费来找我的时候
By the time they came to me with this severance package,

874
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,640
它与保密协议有关
it was tied to an NDA.

875
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:49,280
我松了一口气
I was relieved.

876
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,450
所以 我 呃...
So, I, uh...

877
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:54,180
我拿了钱
I took the money.

878
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,890
我闭口不谈
I kept my mouth shut,

879
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,820
把它全部灌进我的喉咙
poured it all down my throat.

880
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:03,460
但对于那段经历 我仍然感到深深的内疚和羞愧
But I still carry a lot of guilt and shame about that time.

881
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,930
我一直认为我是个懦夫
And I keep thinking I was a coward.

882
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:08,630
我很虚弱 确实如此
And I was weak. I was.

883
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,460
我昨晚接到某人的电话
I got a call from someone last night,

884
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:16,010
他听起来很……失落……
and he just sounded so... lost...

885
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,380
并且破损
and broken.

886
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,410
老实说 我认为他不会成功
And I don't think he's gonna make it, honestly.

887
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,020
我不想落得这样的下场
I don't wanna end up like that.

888
