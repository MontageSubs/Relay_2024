Thank you.

我在团队里
I was in a team,

69
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,500
负责用精准育种
uh, developing a new wheat strain

70
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,140
开发一种抗虫害的新小麦品种
resistant to insect predation through precision breeding.

71
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,630
有点像基因改造
It's... It's like genetic modification,

72
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,380
不过是靠自然杂交
only it's using natural processes,

73
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,500
所以不受那类严格监管
so it's not subject to the same tight regulation.

总之
Anyway.

75
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,920
我们进展不错
We were making progress,

76
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,350
但后来发现对人类食物链可能有害
but we were noticing possible human food-chain issues.

77
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,810
有封邮件转发给我
Um, and then I was CC'ed on an e-mail chain

78
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,200
附件是食品安全评估
where one of the attachments was a food safety assessment

79
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,100
指出了明显的副作用
showing significant side effects.

80
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,430
向高层反映后
When I raised this issue with senior management,

81
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,590
他们说我理解错了
um, they told me that I'd seen the data out of context

82
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,210
叫我别担心
and not to worry.

83
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,770
但很快我被调走了
But then, um, soon, I was transferred

84
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,330
调到曼哈顿来了
to another department here in Manhattan.

85
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,410
做文职和数据工作
Office work, data assessment.

86
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,970
两个月后
Um, and then, two months later,

87
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,520
因为小小的打卡疏忽把我开了
I was dismissed on a minor time card violation,

88
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,550
现在还对我不断地骚扰
and now I'm being subjected to escalating harassment.

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,130
呃...
Uh...

90
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,140
深表同情 格兰特女士
I'm sorry to hear that, Ms. Grant.

91
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,910
他们为什么这样对您？
Why do you think this is happening?

92
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,910
我觉得...
I felt, um...

93
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,370
我觉得有责任把那份食品安全评估带走留证
Well, I felt I had a duty to take a copy of the food safety assessment as evidence.

94
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,240
您从前雇主那偷了文件？
You stole documents from your former employers?

95
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,880
偷？ 这能叫偷？
Is that... Is that stealing?

96
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,970
请问为什么找我们律所处理？
May I ask why you decided to discuss this issue with our firm?

97
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,390
有人介绍的
I followed a recommendation.

98
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,390
请问谁介绍的？
May I ask from whom?

99
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,280
一个朋友 不方便透露
A friend. It wouldn't be appropriate to say who.

100
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,040
格兰特女士 可以理解您的初衷
Ms. Grant, I commend you on your intentions here,

101
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,430
但我们早已不接这类案子
but we're no longer looking for this type of business.

102
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,160
有很多更专业的举报人支持机构
Uh, there are a number of highly regarded whistleblower support organizations

103
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,760
非常专业...
much better prepared...

104
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,140
不 我不是要揭发
No. It's not whistle blowing support I need.

105
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,900
恰恰相反
It's the opposite.

106
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,130

I just want to give everything back

Please. Please.

有谁能帮我吗？
Is there anyone who can help me?

110
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,520
可以找正规的专业机构 但...
Well, as I said, there are official channels, but, uh...

111
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,420
好吧...
Look, um...

112
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,830
我们也会把人介绍给非正式渠道
There are unofficial ones we've referred people to in the past.

113
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,020

Just take this number, and maybe they can help you.

That's kind of the point. It's a messaging service.

117
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,690
他们会回电
They call you back...

118
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,670
也可能不回
or they don't.

119
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,310
把实情电话里讲清楚
Just be honest about your situation.

120
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
都准备好了
You are all set.

最近情况更加艰难
It's been even more of a struggle recently

131
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,370

嗯？因为机场安检的事
Hm? 'Cause the airport security thing,

362
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,370
它很聪明 也很紧凑
it was smart, it was tight.

363
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,000
为什么要把我们送到匹兹堡？
Why send us all the way to Pittsburgh?

如果他们联系您 请不要回应

386
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,670

387

425
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,950

If they did, there would be a forwarding address on file,

440

是的 邮件转发

443
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,510
哦天哪 这太有道理了
Oh, my gosh. That makes total sense.

He just moved here, actually. Can you tell me something?

新的目的地会显示在旧的跟踪号码上吗？
Will the new destination show up on that old tracking number?

446
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,490
现在 事情是这样的
Now, there's the thing.

447

01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,490
好的
All right.

817
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,270
是霍夫曼
It's Hoffman.

818
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,200
我一直在查看各个城镇的讣告
I've been checking the obituaries of the towns

819
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,910
这是 Optimo 试验的一部分
that were part of Optimo's trials.

820
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:59,340
健康的年轻人突然死亡
Healthy young people suddenly dying.

821
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,980
还有多少？
How many more are there?

822
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:06,780
我们都知道这些试验是不够的
We all knew the trials were inadequate.

823
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:11,250
在我们了解情况之前 他们就说一切都安全了
They said things were safe way before we knew enough.

824
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,320
你知道它分布有多广
You know how widely it was distributed.

825
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,590
数百万人将受到影响
Millions of people will have been affected,

826
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,830
但 Optimo 会否认这一点
but Optimo will deny it.

827
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,300
我本来有机会做某事 但我却搞砸了
I had a chance to do something, and I blew it.

828
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,210
我的手上沾满了鲜血
I've got blood on my hands.

829
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:35,080
这不是你的错 你帮助了我
It's not your fault. You helped me.

830
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:40,180
谢谢 我不会再打扰你了
Thank you. I won't bother you again.

831
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,630
我是乔恩 我是个酒鬼
I'm Jon, and I'm an alcoholic.

832
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:57,200
你好 乔恩
Hi, Jon.

833
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:01,540
作为穆斯林长大 你根本不应该喝酒
Growing up Muslim, you're not supposed to drink at all.

834
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,740
我 呃……
I, uh...

835
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,340
所以 我是在纽约长大的穆斯林……
So, I grew up Muslim in New York...

836
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:10,050
9/11 事件后
post 9/11.

837
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,010
这太疯狂了
It was crazy.

838
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:16,320
我认为喝酒可以帮助我融入
I figured drinking would help me to fit in

839
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,390
并与人们建立更多联系
and just connect to people more.

840
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,360
确实如此 有一点
And it did, a little.

841
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,770
并没有阻止我经常被踢屁股
Didn't stop me getting my ass kicked all the time.

842
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:31,910
但当这种情况发生时 它会让我变得麻木
But when that happened, it would help me go numb.

843
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:34,710
所以 无论哪种方式 它都是有帮助的
So, either way, it helped.

844
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:38,040
然后我在华尔街找到了一份工作
And then I got a job on Wall Street.

845
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,680
气氛非常紧张
It was intense.

846
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,610
喝酒是融入社会的一部分
Drinking was part of fitting in.

847
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,980
这是一种处理方式
And it was a way of dealing

848
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,150
面临着实现这些疯狂目标的压力
with pressure to meet these crazy targets.

849
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,250
没有办法见到他们
There was no way of meeting them.

850
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,520
不违反规则
Not without bending the rules

851
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,090
并欺骗别人
and screwing people over.

852
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,220
尽管我很想参与其中
Much as I wanted to be a part of something,

853
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,800
我不想参与其中
I didn't wanna be a part of that.

854
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,090
所以我开始收集信息
So, I started gathering information,

855
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,040
我把它交给了我的上级
and I took it to my superiors.

856
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,400
他们看了看
They took a look at it.

857
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,600
但实际上什么也没发生
And nothing really happened.

858
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:14,110
这次调查是片面的
The investigation was one- sided.

859
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,080
一切都过去了 当一切过去之后
It all blew over. And when it did,

860
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,020
我认识很久的人都背弃了我
people I had known a long time turned their backs on me,

861
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,020
开始散布关于我的谣言
started spreading rumors about me.

862
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:29,700
你知道 质疑我的理智和正直
You know, questioning my sanity and my integrity.

863
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:36,100
我开始变得偏执
And I started to become, uh, paranoid

864
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,070
并且具有攻击性并且醉酒
and aggressive and drunk.

865
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,870
当他们拿着遣散费来找我的时候
By the time they came to me with this severance package,

866
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,640
它与保密协议有关
it was tied to an NDA.

867
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:49,280
我松了一口气
I was relieved.

868
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,450
所以 我 呃...
So, I, uh...

869
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:54,180
我拿了钱
I took the money.

870
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,890
我闭口不谈
I kept my mouth shut,

871
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,820
把它全部灌进我的喉咙
poured it all down my throat.

872
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:03,460
但对于那段经历 我仍然感到深深的内疚和羞愧
But I still carry a lot of guilt and shame about that time.

873
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,930
我一直认为我是个懦夫
And I keep thinking I was a coward.

874
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:08,630
我很虚弱 确实如此
And I was weak. I was.

875
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,460
我昨晚接到某人的电话
I got a call from someone last night,

876
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:16,010
他听起来很……失落……
and he just sounded so... lost...

877
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,380
并且破损
and broken.

878
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,410
老实说 我认为他不会成功
And I don't think he's gonna make it, honestly.

879
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,020
我不想落得这样的下场
I don't wanna end up like that.

记者或他们的读者真正关心的想法

1010

无论如何 大多数媒体都与我们合作

所以他们不会匆忙发表

社交媒体上只剩下阴谋论者了

如果你表现得好的话 你也会如此
And you, too, if you behave yourself.

1025
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,590
你一定是疯了
You gotta be out your fucking mind.

1026
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,220
我还有其他客户需要考虑

have adverse effects, and they knew about it.

1090
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,160
他们试图掩盖证据
They tried to cover up the evidence.

1091
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,700
我收到了内部备忘录
I got the internal memos.

1092
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,570
我收到了电子邮件

1093

我得到了一切
I got everything.

1094
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:57,770
你为什么会有它？

1095
01:41:58,310 --> 01:42:01,340
这就是我的工作 我帮助那些发现类似情况的人
This is what I do. I help people who find things like this.

1096
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:03,360
他们看到了不该看到的东西
Who see things maybe they shouldn't have,

1097
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,850
他们本应视而不见 但他们却做不到
who should have looked the other way, but they can't.

1098
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:08,750
现在我必须把它交给我信任的人
Now I gotta turn it over to somebody I trust.

1099
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:15,160
是的
Yeah.

1100
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:22,290
那里有点重
It's a little heavy there.

1101
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,400
