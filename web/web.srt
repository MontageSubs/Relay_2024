Thank you.

我在团队里
I was in a team,

68
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,500
负责用精确育种
uh, developing a new wheat strain

69
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,140
开发一种抗虫害的新小麦品种
resistant to insect predation through precision breeding.

70
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,630
有点像基因改造
It's... It's like genetic modification,

71
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,380
不过是靠自然杂交
only it's using natural processes,

72
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,500
所以不受那类严格监管
so it's not subject to the same tight regulation.

总之
Anyway.

74
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,920
我们进展不错
We were making progress,

75
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,350
但后来发现对人类食物链可能有害
but we were noticing possible human food-chain issues.

76
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,810
有封邮件转发给我
Um, and then I was CC'ed on an e-mail chain

77
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,200
附件是食品安全评估
where one of the attachments was a food safety assessment

78
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,100
指出了明显的副作用
showing significant side effects.

79
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,430
向高层反映后
When I raised this issue with senior management,

80
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,590
他们说我理解错了
um, they told me that I'd seen the data out of context

81
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,210
叫我别担心
and not to worry.

82
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,770
但很快我被调走了
But then, um, soon, I was transferred

83
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,330
调到曼哈顿来了
to another department here in Manhattan.

84
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,410
做文职和数据工作
Office work, data assessment.

85
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,970
两个月后
Um, and then, two months later,

86
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,520
因为小小的打卡疏忽把我开了
I was dismissed on a minor time card violation,

87
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,550
现在还对我不断地骚扰
and now I'm being subjected to escalating harassment.

88
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,130
呃...
Uh...

89
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,140
深表同情 格兰特女士
I'm sorry to hear that, Ms. Grant.

90
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,910
他们为什么这样对您？
Why do you think this is happening?

91
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,910
我觉得...
I felt, um...

92
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,370
我觉得有责任把那份评估报告带走留证
Well, I felt I had a duty to take a copy of the food safety assessment as evidence.

93
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,240
您从前雇主那偷了文件？
You stole documents from your former employers?

94
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,880
偷？ 这能叫偷？
Is that... Is that stealing?

95
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,970
请问为什么找我们律所处理？
May I ask why you decided to discuss this issue with our firm?

96
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,390
有人介绍的
I followed a recommendation.

97
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,390
请问谁介绍的？
May I ask from whom?

98
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,280
一个朋友 不方便透露
A friend. It wouldn't be appropriate to say who.

99
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,040
格兰特女士 可以理解您的初衷
Ms. Grant, I commend you on your intentions here,

100
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,430
但我们早已不接这类案子
but we're no longer looking for this type of business.

101
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,160
有很多更专业的举报人支持机构
Uh, there are a number of highly regarded whistleblower support organizations

102
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,760
非常专业...
much better prepared...

103
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,140
不 我不是要揭发
No. It's not whistle blowing support I need.

104
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,900
恰恰相反
It's the opposite.

105
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,130
我只想把文件都还回去
I just want to give everything back

106
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,350
乖乖闭嘴 过上正常生活
and promise to keep my mouth shut and get on with my life.

00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,630
请帮帮我 帮帮我
Please. Please.

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,840
有谁能帮我吗？
Is there anyone who can help me?

109
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,520
可以找正规的专业机构 但...
Well, as I said, there are official channels, but, uh...

110
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,420
好吧...
Look, um...

111
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,830
我们也会把人介绍给非正式渠道
There are unofficial ones we've referred people to in the past.

112
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,020
给你这个号码 也许能帮上忙
Just take this number, and maybe they can help you.

113
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,370
这是谁？
Who is he?

没见过他 也可能是她 或者一群人
I've never met him, or her or they.

115
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,650
匿名是重点 这只是用来留言的
That's kind of the point. It's a messaging service.

116
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,690
他们会回电
They call you back...

117
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,670
也可能不回
or they don't.

118
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,310
把实情电话里讲清楚
Just be honest about your situation.

119
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
都准备好了
You are all set.

但最近很难熬
It's been even more of a struggle recently

128
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,640
老诱因又来了
because there's why I drank in the first place,

129
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,000
加上现在工作压力大
and then there's me doing what I do.

130
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,180
毕竟我以警察身份为荣

差不多是这样
Pretty much.

which are evidence of an unlawful cover-up.

143
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,160
我本来想公之于众 现在我反悔了
I was gonna go public, but I changed my mind.

144
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,360
告诉我该怎么办 我会全力配合

157
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,990
来电者可能有听力障碍
The person who has called you is likely to be deaf or hard of hearing.

158
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,890

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:05,810
我在一个项目里 研究抗虫小麦新品种
I was in a research group developing a new strain of insect-resistant wheat.

173
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,560
有份食品安全报告出来

175
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,930
向上级报告后
I told my bosses.

176
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,530
结果我被调走
Next thing I knew, I'd been reassigned

177
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,090
后来干脆被开除了
and later dismissed.

178
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,130
新品种照常生产
Production of the new strain has gone ahead,

179
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,940
报告被压了下去
but these findings have been suppressed.

180
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:30,390
我设法留了份报告副本
Um, but I was able to get a copy of that food safety report out of the building.

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,770
“什么副作用？”
"You mention side effects."

184
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,630
个别案例里有

190
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,060
没有这份报告
But without the information I have,

191
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,610
根本无法让人联想到这食物上
it will be impossible to trace it back to the food people have eaten.

192
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,250
“您的文件能证明他们的不法行为吗？”
"Would you say this document contains clear evidence of malfeasance?"

193
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,310
比起他们造假的报告 这份是铁证如山
Compared to the fraudulent version of their report, yes.

194
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,540
请传达
Go ahead.

195
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,170
“他们给钱让您别说吗？ ”
"Did they offer you a cash settlement in exchange for your silence?"

196
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,750
起初他们想 但我没接受
Um, initially, yes, but I wasn't interested.

197
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,500
我想揭发真相
I wanted to do the right thing.

198
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,070
然后他们开始威胁我

203
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,800
车被拖走当证物
They towed the car away as evidence,

204

下周证监会就会把这事敲定
which will be confirmed at an SEC filing next week.

243
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,490

If the information I had went public, it would break that deal.

244
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,530
他们会不择手段阻止我

00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,615
不能帮客户开邮箱
to open mailboxes for our clients.

405
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,794
- 哦 不会吧 - 没办法
- Oh, no. Really? - Sorry.

406
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:00,609
都怪我 我不该忘带那破钥匙
It's my fault. Should've remembered the darn key.

407
00:38:00,634 --> 00:38:01,734
嗯
Yeah.

408
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:05,922
只 只是我家狗病得很重
Just... My dog is really sick.

409
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:09,465
- 哦 - 我头都乱套了
- Oh. - Yeah. My head is a mess.

410
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,790
对 对不起
I... I'm sorry.

411
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:13,875
- 是啊 挺遗憾的 - 嗯
- Well, that's a shame, ma'am. - Yeah.

412
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,889
是啊 年纪大了 老姑娘了
She's just a... tired old girl.

413
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:20,412
- 唉 - 撑不了多久了
- Aw. - Won't be too much longer now.

414
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:26,569
能不能麻烦您帮我看下包裹到没到？
I don't suppose you'd be able to just check to see if the package has arrived?

415
00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:28,486
哦 呃...
Oh. Um...

416
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:30,573
好 我去看下
Uh, okay.

417
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:32,452
- 太感谢啦 - 请稍等
- Thank you. - You wait here.

418
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,836
抱歉 女士 邮箱是空的
I'm sorry, ma'am. There's nothing there.

419
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:47,765
加急的 应该早到了
Well, it was sent Priority Mail. It should have already arrived.

420
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,190
抱歉
I'm sorry.

421
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:52,059
哦 好吧
Huh. Okay.

422
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,660
今天真不顺
Not a good day.

423
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,475
你朋友最近搬家了吗？
Did your friend recently move, by any chance?

424
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,815
要是搬了 系统里就有转寄地址
If they did, there would be a forwarding address on file,

425
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,870
包裹被转错的话就会晚到
and if it was rerouted, well, that could explain the delay.

426
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:07,758
对 有转寄
Yes. Mail forwarding.

427
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:09,585
天呐 这说得通了
Oh, my gosh. That makes total sense.

428
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,640
他刚搬过来 麻烦问一下
He just moved here, actually. Can you tell me something?

429
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:18,185
旧运单号上显示新目的地吗？
Will the new destination show up on that old tracking number?

430
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,490
是这样的
Now, there's the thing.

431
00:39:19,515 --> 00:39:22,135
运单信息不一定更新转寄信息
Tracking does not always carry over to forwarding

432
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,125
那是两个不同的系统
because they're different services.

We all knew the trials were inadequate.

811
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:11,250
在我们了解情况之前 他们就说一切都安全了
They said things were safe way before we knew enough.

812
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,320
你知道它分布有多广
You know how widely it was distributed.

813
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,590
数百万人将受到影响
Millions of people will have been affected,

814
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,830
但 Optimo 会否认这一点
but Optimo will deny it.

815
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,300
我本来有机会做某事 但我却搞砸了
I had a chance to do something, and I blew it.

816
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,210
我的手上沾满了鲜血
I've got blood on my hands.

817
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:35,080
这不是你的错 你帮助了我
It's not your fault. You helped me.

818
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:40,180
谢谢 我不会再打扰你了
Thank you. I won't bother you again.

819
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,630
我是乔恩 我是个酒鬼
I'm Jon, and I'm an alcoholic.

820
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:57,200
你好 乔恩
Hi, Jon.

821
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:01,540
作为穆斯林长大 你根本不应该喝酒
Growing up Muslim, you're not supposed to drink at all.

822
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,740
我 呃……
I, uh...

823
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:07,340
所以 我是在纽约长大的穆斯林……
So, I grew up Muslim in New York...

824
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:10,050
9/11 事件后
post 9/11.

825
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,010
这太疯狂了
It was crazy.

826
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:16,320
我认为喝酒可以帮助我融入
I figured drinking would help me to fit in

827
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,390
并与人们建立更多联系
and just connect to people more.

828
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,360
确实如此 有一点
And it did, a little.

829
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,770
并没有阻止我经常被踢屁股
Didn't stop me getting my ass kicked all the time.

830
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:31,910
但当这种情况发生时 它会让我变得麻木
But when that happened, it would help me go numb.

831
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:34,710
所以 无论哪种方式 它都是有帮助的
So, either way, it helped.

832
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:38,040
然后我在华尔街找到了一份工作
And then I got a job on Wall Street.

833
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,680
气氛非常紧张
It was intense.

834
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,610
喝酒是融入社会的一部分
Drinking was part of fitting in.

835
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,980
这是一种处理方式
And it was a way of dealing

836
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,150
面临着实现这些疯狂目标的压力
with pressure to meet these crazy targets.

837
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:48,250
没有办法见到他们
There was no way of meeting them.

838
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,520
不违反规则
Not without bending the rules

839
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,090
并欺骗别人
and screwing people over.

840
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,220
尽管我很想参与其中
Much as I wanted to be a part of something,

841
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,800
我不想参与其中
I didn't wanna be a part of that.

842
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,090
所以我开始收集信息
So, I started gathering information,

843
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,040
我把它交给了我的上级
and I took it to my superiors.

844
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,400
他们看了看
They took a look at it.

845
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,600
但实际上什么也没发生
And nothing really happened.

846
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:14,110
这次调查是片面的
The investigation was one- sided.

847
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,080
一切都过去了 当一切过去之后
It all blew over. And when it did,

848
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,020
我认识很久的人都背弃了我
people I had known a long time turned their backs on me,

849
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,020
开始散布关于我的谣言
started spreading rumors about me.

850
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:29,700
你知道 质疑我的理智和正直
You know, questioning my sanity and my integrity.

851
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:36,100
我开始变得偏执
And I started to become, uh, paranoid

852
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,070
并且具有攻击性并且醉酒
and aggressive and drunk.

853
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,870
当他们拿着遣散费来找我的时候
By the time they came to me with this severance package,

854
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,640
它与保密协议有关
it was tied to an NDA.

855
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:49,280
我松了一口气
I was relieved.

856
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,450
所以 我 呃...
So, I, uh...

857
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:54,180
我拿了钱
I took the money.

858
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,890
我闭口不谈
I kept my mouth shut,

859
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,820
把它全部灌进我的喉咙
poured it all down my throat.

860
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:03,460
但对于那段经历 我仍然感到深深的内疚和羞愧
But I still carry a lot of guilt and shame about that time.

861
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,930
我一直认为我是个懦夫
And I keep thinking I was a coward.

862
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:08,630
我很虚弱 确实如此
And I was weak. I was.

863
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,460
我昨晚接到某人的电话
I got a call from someone last night,

864
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:16,010
他听起来很……失落……
and he just sounded so... lost...

865
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,380
并且破损
and broken.

866
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,410
老实说 我认为他不会成功
And I don't think he's gonna make it, honestly.

867
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:29,020
我不想落得这样的下场
I don't wanna end up like that.

别按他们说的做 他们在跟踪我

莎拉 听我说 你得保持冷静

—这是我的错 —听我说

我们会解决这个问题的

997
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,150
记者或他们的读者真正关心的想法
The idea of journalists or their readers actually caring,

998
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,050
这是一个可爱、自由的幻想

999
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,830
无论如何 大多数媒体都与我们合作
Most of the media work with us anyway,

1000
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,700
所以他们不会匆忙发表
so they won't publish in a hurry.

1001
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:59,460
社交媒体上只剩下阴谋论者了
And that leaves the conspiracy theorists on social media.

1002
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:00,470

1006
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:06,700
信封上贴有标签
The envelopes are labeled

1007
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:08,400
——并密封 ——事情是这样的

1008
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:11,580
我们会和你一起去

including your safety copy, and we'll let her go unharmed.

1012
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,940
如果你表现得好的话 你也会如此
And you, too, if you behave yourself.

1013
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,590
你一定是疯了
You gotta be out your fucking mind.

1014
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,220
我还有其他客户需要考虑
I have other clients to consider.

1015
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,850
你真的认为你有选择吗？

1016
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:00,990
是的？

1022
