谢谢
Thank you.

64
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,640
我在团队里
I was in a team,

65
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,500
负责用精确育种
uh, developing a new wheat strain

66
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,140
开发一种抗虫害的新小麦品种
resistant to insect predation through precision breeding.

67
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,630
有点像基因改造
It's... It's like genetic modification,

68
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,380
不过是靠自然杂交
only it's using natural processes,

69
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,500
所以不受那类严格监管
so it's not subject to the same tight regulation.

总之
Anyway.

71
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,920
我们进展不错
We were making progress,

72
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,350
但后来发现其对人类食物链可能有害
but we were noticing possible human food-chain issues.

73
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,810
有封邮件抄送给我
Um, and then I was CC'ed on an e-mail chain

74
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,200
附件里有一份食品安全评估
where one of the attachments was a food safety assessment

75
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,100
指出产品有明显的不良反应
showing significant side effects.

76
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,430
我向高层反映后
When I raised this issue with senior management,

77
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,590
他们说我理解错了
um, they told me that I'd seen the data out of context

78
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,210
叫我别担心
and not to worry.

79
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,770
但很快我被调走了
But then, um, soon, I was transferred

80
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,330
调到曼哈顿来了

Um, and then, two months later,

83
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,520
因为小小的打卡疏忽 他们就把我开了
I was dismissed on a minor time card violation,

84
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,550
现在还对我不断地骚扰
and now I'm being subjected to escalating harassment.

呃...
Uh...

86
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,140
深表同情 格兰特女士
I'm sorry to hear that, Ms. Grant.

87
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,910
他们为什么这样对您？
Why do you think this is happening?

88
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,910
我觉得...
I felt, um...

89
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,370
我觉得有责任把那份评估报告带走留证
Well, I felt I had a duty to take a copy of the food safety assessment as evidence.

90
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,240
您从前雇主那偷了文件？
You stole documents from your former employers?

91
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,880
偷？ 这能叫偷？
Is that... Is that stealing?

92
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,970
请问为什么找我们律所处理？
May I ask why you decided to discuss this issue with our firm?

93
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,390
有人介绍的
I followed a recommendation.

94
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,390
请问谁介绍的？
May I ask from whom?

95
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,280
一个朋友 不方便透露
A friend. It wouldn't be appropriate to say who.

96
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,040
格兰特女士 可以理解您的初衷
Ms. Grant, I commend you on your intentions here,

97
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,430
但我们早已不接这类案子
but we're no longer looking for this type of business.

98
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,160
有很多更专业的机构 能帮助您揭发内幕
Uh, there are a number of highly regarded whistleblower support organizations

99
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,760
非常专业...
much better prepared...

100
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,140
不 我不是要揭发
No. It's not whistle blowing support I need.

101
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,900
恰恰相反
It's the opposite.

102
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,130
我只想把文件都还回去
I just want to give everything back

103
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,350
保证守口如瓶 回到正常生活
and promise to keep my mouth shut and get on with my life.

104
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,630
请帮帮我 帮帮我
Please. Please.

105
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,840
有谁能帮我吗？
Is there anyone who can help me?

106
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,520
可以找正规的专业机构 但...
Well, as I said, there are official channels, but, uh...

107
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,420
好吧...
Look, um...

108
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,830
我们也会把人介绍给非正式渠道
There are unofficial ones we've referred people to in the past.

109
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,020
给您这个号码 也许能帮上忙
Just take this number, and maybe they can help you.

110
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,370
这是谁？
Who is he?

111
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,940
没见过他 也可能是她 或者一群人
I've never met him, or her or they.

112
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,650
匿名才是重点 那只是个传话服务
That's kind of the point. It's a messaging service.

113
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,690
他们会回电
They call you back...

114
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,670
也可能不回
or they don't.

115
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,310
把实情电话里讲清楚
Just be honest about your situation.

116
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
都准备好了
You are all set.

117

Thanks for doing this on short notice.

119

That's what we do. Enjoy your stay.

但最近特难熬
It's been even more of a struggle recently

125
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,640
老诱因又来了
because there's why I drank in the first place,

126
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,000
加上工作中乱七八糟的事
and then there's me doing what I do.

127
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,180
毕竟我以当警察为荣
'Cause I'm proud of serving on the force.

128
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,610
我也尽量按规矩办事
And I stay on the up and up.

129
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,510
差不多是这样
Pretty much.

130
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,780
但...
But, um...

131
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,020
我每天看到同事们那样做事儿...
What I see on the daily, amongst my fellow officers...

132
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,720

00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,830
能麻烦帮我拿一下吗？
Would you be able just to grab it for me?

406
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,600
抱歉 女士 我们有规定
Well, I'm afraid, ma'am, that regulations do not permit me

407
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,620
不能帮客户开信箱
to open mailboxes for our clients.

408
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,790
- 哦 不会吧 - 没办法
- Oh, no. Really? - Sorry.

409
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,610
都怪我 我不该忘带那破钥匙
It's my fault. Should've remembered the darn key.

410
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,730
嗯
Yeah.

411
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,920
只 只是我家狗病得很重
Just... My dog is really sick.

412
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,470
- 哦 - 现在脑袋一片浆糊
- Oh. - Yeah. My head is a mess.

413
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,790
对 对不起
I... I'm sorry.

414
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,880
- 是啊 挺遗憾的 - 嗯
- Well, that's a shame, ma'am. - Yeah.

415
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,890
是啊 年纪大了 老姑娘了
She's just a... tired old girl.

416
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,410
- 唉 - 撑不了多久了
- Aw. - Won't be too much longer now.

417
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,570
能不能麻烦您帮我看下包裹到没到？
I don't suppose you'd be able to just check to see if the package has arrived?

418
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,490
哦 呃...
Oh. Um...

419
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,570
好 我去看下
Uh, okay.

420
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,450
- 麻烦啦 - 请稍等
- Thank you. - You wait here.

421
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,840
抱歉 女士 信箱是空的
I'm sorry, ma'am. There's nothing there.

422
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,770
特快的 应该早到了
Well, it was sent Priority Mail. It should have already arrived.

423
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,190
抱歉
I'm sorry.

424
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,060
哦 好吧
Huh. Okay.

425
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,660
今天真不顺
Not a good day.

426
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,480
你朋友最近搬家了吗？
Did your friend recently move, by any chance?

427
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,820
要是搬了 系统里就有转寄地址
If they did, there would be a forwarding address on file,

428
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,870
包裹被转错的话就会晚到
and if it was rerouted, well, that could explain the delay.

429
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,760
对 有转寄
Yes. Mail forwarding.

430
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,590
天呐 这说得通了
Oh, my gosh. That makes total sense.

431
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,620
他刚搬过来
He just moved here, actually.

432
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,130
麻烦问一下
Can you tell me something?

433
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,190
旧运单号上会显示新目的地吗？
Will the new destination show up on that old tracking number?

434
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,500
是这样的
Now, there's the thing.

435
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,140
运单信息不一定更新转寄信息
Tracking does not always carry over to forwarding

436
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,130
那是两个不同的系统
because they're different services.

“否则我们就撒手 懂吗？”
"we will walk away. Do you understand?"

813
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:12,450
懂
Yes.

{\an8}（收件人 莎拉·格兰特）

819
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,570
{\an8}（赛博育种）

820

{\an8}（北欧盖洛餐厅）

822
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,360
最后地点在贝尔
We tracked it as far as Bell.

823
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:57,380
那儿是个全国物流中心
There's a national distribution center there.

824
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:59,270
之后就没信号了
Then we lost it.

825
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:02,070
信号还回得来吗？
Will the signal come back?

826
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:05,040
里头没有备用电池
There were no backup batteries.

827
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,840
接下来会往哪寄？
Where's it gonna go from there?

828
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,950
全国各地到处都有可能
It could literally be anywhere.

{\an8}（运单查询 您的包裹已送达波基普西）

一切安好
All right.

832
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,510
一切安好
All right.

833
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,270
我是霍夫曼
It's Hoffman.

834
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,280
我一直在翻那些参加了
I've been checking the obituaries of the towns

835
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,830
奥蒂莫试验城镇的讣告
that were part of Optimo's trials.

836
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:59,350
健康年轻人接二连三地死去
Healthy young people suddenly dying.

837
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,080
还有多少没被发现的？
How many more are there?

838
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,590
内部都明白这些试验不严谨
We all knew the trials were inadequate.

839
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:11,380
还没弄清楚前 公司就说一切安全了
They said things were safe way before we knew enough.

840
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:16,050
你知道覆盖面有多广吗
You know how widely it was distributed.

841
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,470
上百万人会受影响
Millions of people will have been affected,

842
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:23,570
可奥蒂莫会否认一切
but Optimo will deny it.

843
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,730
我本有机会揭发的 给浪费了
I had a chance to do something, and I blew it.

844
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,750
我手上沾满了血
I've got blood on my hands.

845
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:36,730
这不是你的错 你只是帮忙的
It's not your fault. You helped me.

846
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:40,710
谢谢你 我不会再来打扰了
Thank you. I won't bother you again.

847
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,710
我叫乔恩 我有酒瘾
I'm Jon, and I'm an alcoholic.

848
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:57,390
欢迎 乔恩
Hi, Jon.

849
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:02,080
我打小就是穆斯林 按规矩根本不能喝酒
Growing up Muslim, you're not supposed to drink at all.

850
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,540
我...
I, uh...

851
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,470
我作为穆斯林 在911后的纽约...
So, I grew up Muslim in New York...

852
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,260
长大
post 9/11.

853
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,220
太艰难了
It was crazy.

854
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,910
我以为喝酒能帮我合群
I figured drinking would help me to fit in

855
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,120
跟人打成一片
and just connect to people more.

856
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,530
确实 有一点作用
And it did, a little.

857
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:27,030
可是还是经常被人痛揍
Didn't stop me getting my ass kicked all the time.

858
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:32,360
被打的时候 喝酒能麻痹痛苦
But when that happened, it would help me go numb.

859
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,790
总之 酒是帮了我
So, either way, it helped.

860
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,050
后来去华尔街工作了
And then I got a job on Wall Street.

861
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,620
工作强度非常高
It was intense.

862
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,720
喝酒也是合群的一部分
Drinking was part of fitting in.

863
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,160
也用来应付那些
And it was a way of dealing

864
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:46,260
变态业绩指标的压力
with pressure to meet these crazy targets.

865
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,210
根本不可能完成那些指标
There was no way of meeting them.

866
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,400
除非违反规则
Not without bending the rules

867
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,240
坑害别人
and screwing people over.

868
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,370
我确实想融入什么
Much as I wanted to be a part of something,

869
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,270
但不想同流合污
I didn't wanna be a part of that.

870
01:13:57,290 --> 01:14:00,180
所以我开始搜集证据
So, I started gathering information,

871
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,220
然后交给了我的领导们
and I took it to my superiors.

872
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,350
他们瞧了瞧
They took a look at it.

873
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,060
结果没下文了
And nothing really happened.

874
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:15,050
调查有失公允 明显包庇
The investigation was one-sided.

875
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,170
事一平息
It all blew over. And when it did,

876
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,260
那些老相识都背离我
people I had known a long time turned their backs on me,

877
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,270
到处传我的坏话
started spreading rumors about me.

878
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:29,850
他们开始怀疑我的头脑和人品
You know, questioning my sanity and my integrity.

879
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:36,180
我开始变得偏执 易怒
And I started to become, uh, paranoid

880
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,720
还喝得烂醉
and aggressive and drunk.

881
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:46,990
公司拿着保密协议和离职补偿找我时
By the time they came to me with this severance package, it was tied to an NDA.

882
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:49,180
我如释重负
I was relieved.

883
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:52,380
所以 我...
So, I, uh...

884
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:54,310
我收了那笔钱
I took the money.

885
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,040
我守口如瓶
I kept my mouth shut,

886
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,150
大口灌酒把事塞回去
poured it all down my throat.

887
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:03,790
但我对那经历满是羞愧
But I still carry a lot of guilt and shame about that time.

888
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:06,160
我老觉得自己是个懦夫
And I keep thinking I was a coward.

889
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:08,940
我确实很懦弱 是真的
And I was weak. I was.

890
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,490
昨晚有人打电话给我
I got a call from someone last night,

891
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,960
他听起来完全...崩溃...
and he just sounded so... lost...

892
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,810
无助
and broken.

893
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:24,920
老实说 我觉得他熬不过去了
And I don't think he's gonna make it, honestly.

894
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:30,760
我不想最后落到那样的结局
I don't wanna end up like that.

895
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,020
